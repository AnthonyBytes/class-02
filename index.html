        Hello! Welcome to my page! My name is Anthony, but my friends call me Ant. 🐜 I currently live in Seattle where it always rains. I went to the University of Washington where I studied Communications. I was a technical recruiter the past 7 years with companies like Amazon, Meta and Gearbox. My goal over the next year is to become a coding wizard. I have one dog, a corgi named Jakr. Below are a few of my favorite things.
